        contorta-dominated montane forests of western Canada with relatively dense
        tree canopies have ground layers with abundant bryophytes, especially the
        feather mosses (Pleurozium schreberi and Hylocomium splendens), while those
        with more open canopies are dominated by species of reindeer lichens, especially
        Cladonia arbuscula s.l. and C. rangiferina s.l. Woodland caribou (Rangifer
        tarandus caribou), which are a threatened species in Alberta, prefer open,
        Cladonia-dominated forests for their winter food supply. This study investigated
        if opening the canopy by thinning mature montane forests of the Canadian Rocky
        Mountain foothills would change the abundance of lichens and bryophytes. In
        1997, forests were thinned by removing 20%, 40%, and 60% by volume. In 2016,
        19 years after treatment, we re-surveyed a subset of these plots (n = 97)
        for lichen and bryophyte abundance and species richness by utilizing the amount
        of canopy opening at the plot level as our prime gradient. We then used ordination
        to determine the relationship of control plots to treatment plots. In uncut
        forest, the control plots were highly variable, but were mostly dominated
        by feather mosses, with little or no bare ground. Feather moss abundance was
        lower in treatment plots when compared to control plots, while cover of bare
        ground was greater. Overall, 19 years after treatment, we found that, in treatment
        plots, lichen abundance remained stable or slightly increased, feather mosses
        decreased markedly, and unoccupied space was double that of the control plots.
        We conclude that the canopy opening had little effect on understory and ground
        layer diversity, but considering species abundance (1) bryophytes have not
        recovered after canopy opening, (2) populations of reindeer lichens increased
        marginally, but have not colonized areas left bare from bryophyte dieback,
        and (3), after 19 years there, remains unoccupied areas of bare ground in
        plots with a reduced canopy cover. Our study demonstrated that, with canopy
        cover reduction resulting from forest thinning operations, the ground layer
        diversity is maintained, but recovery of ground layers in old-growth pine-dominated
        forests is not promoted. Therefore, timber harvest that partially opens the
        tree canopy is unlikely to benefit caribou by augmenting or accelerating winter
        food availability and habitat suitability for caribou.", "subject": [{"scheme":

        "Abstract Background Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and interior spruce (Picea
        glauca, Picea engelmannii, and their hybrids) are distantly related conifer
        species. Previous studies identified 47 genes containing variants associated
        with environmental variables in both species, providing evidence of convergent
        local adaptation. However, if the intensity of purifying selection varies
        with the environment, clines in nucleotide diversity could evolve through
        linked (background) selection that would yield allele frequency-environment
        signatures resembling local adaptation. If similar geographic patterns in
        the strength of purifying selection occur in these species, this could result
        in the convergent signatures of local adaptation, especially if the landscape
        of recombination is conserved. In the present study, we investigated whether
        spatially/environmentally varying purifying selection could give rise to the
        convergent signatures of local adaptation that had previously reported. Results
        We analyzed 86 lodgepole pine and 50 interior spruce natural populations spanning
        heterogeneous environments in western Canada where previous analyses had found
        signatures of convergent local adaptation. We estimated nucleotide diversity
        and Tajima\u2019s D for each gene within each population and calculated the
        strength of correlations between nucleotide diversity and environmental variables.
        Overall, these estimates in the genes with previously identified convergent
        local adaptation signatures had no similar pattern between pine and spruce.
        Clines in nucleotide diversity along environmental variables were found for
        interior spruce, but not for lodgepole pine. In spruce, genes with convergent
        adaption signatures showed a higher strength of correlations than genes without
        convergent adaption signatures, but there was no such disparity in pine, which
        suggests the pattern in spruce may have arisen due to a combination of selection
        and hybridization. Conclusions The results rule out purifying/background selection
        as a driver of convergent local adaption signatures in lodgepole pine and
        interior spruce.", "title": "Purifying selection does not drive signatures

        within spatially variable communities that play fundamental roles in the functioning
        of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the underlying ecological mechanisms that
        maintain and regulate the spatial structuring of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities
        are both complex and remain poorly understood. Here, we use a gradient of
        mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) induced tree mortality across
        eleven stands in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests of western Canada
        to investigate: (i) the degree to which spatial structure varies within this
        fungal group, and (ii) how these patterns may be driven by the relative importance
        of tree mortality from changes in understory plant diversity, productivity
        and fine root biomass following tree death. We found that the homogeneity
        of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community increased with increasing tree death,
        aboveground understory productivity and diversity. Whereas, the independent
        effect of fine root biomass, which declined along the same gradient of tree
        mortality, increased the heterogeneity of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community.
        Together, our results demonstrate that large-scale biotic disturbance homogenizes
        the spatial patterns of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities.", "subject": [{"scheme":

        tree species mortality and growth metrics following fires are important to

        dose-response&#8217; relationship between fire behavior and the resultant
        mortality or recovery of the trees. Prior studies have not been conclusive
        due to potential pseudo-replication in the experimental design and time-limited
        observations. We explored whether dose-response relationships are observed
        in ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>) saplings exposed to surface fires
        of increasing fire behavior (as quantified by Fire Radiative Energy&#8212;FRE).
        We confirmed equivalent dose-response relationships to the prior studies that
        were focused on other conifer species. The post-fire growth in the saplings
        that survived the fires decreased with increasing FRE dosages, while the percentage
        mortality in the sapling dosage groups increased with the amount of FRE applied.
        Furthermore, as with lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>), a low FRE dosage
        could be applied that did not yield mortality in any of the replicates (r
        = 10). These results suggest that land management agencies could use planned
        burns to reduce fire hazard while still maintaining a crop of young saplings.
        Incorporation of these results into earth-system models and growth and yield
        models could help reduce uncertainties associated with the impacts of fire
        on timber growth, forest resilience, carbon dynamics, and ecosystem economics.",

        "Abstract Recent regional mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks have generated
        unprecedented tree mortality across the fire\u2010prone landscapes of western
        North American forests and could potentially modify fire severity and postfire
        ecological effects. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, three fires burned through high
        mortality, gray\u2010phase lodgepole pine\u2010dominated forests in the plateau
        regions of central interior British Columbia, Canada, providing an opportunity
        to test for interactions between MPB outbreaks and wildfires. We inventoried
        63 plots that spanned gradients of outbreak severity, fire severity, and burning
        conditions in a wilderness setting. Our objective was to evaluate the influence
        of outbreak severity on fire severity by assessing typical first\u2010order
        fire effects as well as legacy structure related to the consumption of woody
        biomass on snags/trees. We found no evidence of a relationship between outbreak
        severity and fire severity for six of seven first\u2010order fire effects,
        with the exception of deep charring. We found evidence that legacy structure
        in the form of consumed branch structure and deep char development had greater
        odds of occurrence on MPB\u2010killed snags compared to trees killed during
        wildfire. Our results indicate two key findings. First, fire severity as it
        relates to most first\u2010order fire effects measures is not influenced by
        outbreak severity, instead it is more strongly influenced by the interaction
        of fuels, weather, and topography during fire events. Second, our results
        highlight how the interaction between outbreak severity and fire severity
        alters postfire structural legacies and their functional attributes, which
        could have important ecosystem implications.", "title": "Dead forests burning:

        Sheet covered most of southeastern Alaska during the Last Glacial Interval
        (LGI: Marine Isotope Stage 2). Ice began to recede from western Alexander
        Archipelago \u223c17,000 \u00b1 700 yr BP. In this study, pollen analysis
        and radiocarbon dating of three sediment cores were used to reconstruct, for
        the first time, the postglacial development of vegetation in the northwestern
        Alexander Archipelago during the past \u223c15,240 cal yr. Hummingbird Lake
        (HL), on southwestern Baranof Island, yielded a sediment core with one of
        the longest dated records from southeastern Alaska. The earliest part of the
        HL pollen record (\u223c15,240\u201314,040 yr BP) indicates that the earliest
        vegetation was pine (Pinus contorta subsp. contorta) parkland with willows
        (Salix), heaths (Ericaceae), sedges (Cyperaceae), grasses (Poaceae), herbs
        and ferns. Starting at \u223c14,040 yr BP, alder (Alnus) rapidly colonized
        the area as pine populations declined. By 11,400 yr BP, Sitka spruce (Picea
        sitchensis) colonized the area, and soon became the dominant conifer. Mountain
        hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) also colonized the area by \u223c11,400 yr BP,
        followed by western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) at \u223c10,200 yr BP. By
        \u223c9200 yr BP, western hemlock had become the dominant tree species in
        the area. During the late Holocene yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis)
        became established. Two marine sediment cores were also analyzed for pollen,
        with the oldest core from Lower Sitka Sound, between Kruzof and Baranof Islands.
        The lower part of the core consists of interlayered tephras and freshwater
        lake muds that are estimated to be \u223c14,000 to 13,150 yr BP. Pollen evidence
        indicates that the early postglacial vegetation around Sitka Sound was pine
        parkland with alders and abundant ferns. Damage to vegetation around Sitka
        Sound by volcanic eruptions is suggested by abrupt, large shifts in percentages
        of alder and pine pollen, and fern spores in samples adjacent to tephra layers.
        A marine sediment core from Slocum Arm, a fiord on the western coast of Chichagof
        Island, has a basal age of \u223c10,000 yr BP. The pollen record is similar
        to the Holocene pollen record at Hummingbird Lake. The sequence of vegetation
        changes interpreted from the three northwestern Alexander Archipelago pollen

        "abstract": "<i>Research Highlights:</i> The invasive species <i>Pinus contorta</i>,
        has become a new component of the vegetation in the Patagonian Steppe, invading
        the complex matrix of bare ground, tussock grasses and cushion plants. At
        a microsite scale, the type of native vegetation is one of the multiple factors
        determining the establishment of <i>P. contorta</i> and in some cases, increasing
        its survival, and as a result, the invasion of the species. <i>Background
        and Objectives:</i> The presence of trees, particularly pines, where they
        are naturally absent, represents a clear threat to Patagonian steppe ecosystems.
        Thus, understanding the interaction between pines and native plant species
        may be the key to understanding the invasion and applying management actions.
        <i>Pinus contorta</i> is considered one of the most aggressive among the pines
        species, with recognized impacts on regions in the southern hemisphere and
        Europe, and it is one of the main invaders in the Patagonian steppe. Our aim
        in this study is to determine the influence of surrounding vegetation on <i>P.
        contorta</i> spatial distribution, its establishment and future development
        in the Chilean Patagonia. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> We used point pattern
        analysis to determine the existence of spatial associations between <i>P.
        contorta</i> and the resident vegetation of the Patagonian steppe. Further,
        a seeding experiment was carried out to assess the influence of the surrounding
        vegetation during <i>P. contorta</i> establishment and first growing season.
        <i>Results:</i> We found that young <i>P. contorta</i> individuals are positively
        associated with the native cushion plant <i>B. magellanica</i> and also to
        tussock grasses. Seeding experiments showed that <i>P. contorta</i> is influenced
        by resident plant species during establishment and is able to establish on
        any ground cover type in the Patagonian steppe, but some resident plant species
        increase <i>P. contorta</i> survival chances. <i>Conclusions: Pinus contorta</i>
        is interacting with native vegetation and becoming an active component of
        the Patagonian steppe mosaic. Although pines can establish in any type of
        vegetation in the Patagonian steppe mosaics, native cushion and tussock grasses
        may be facilitating the process and promoting pine survival, allowing it to
        survive and thrive in this stressful environment.", "subject": [{"scheme":

        pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), a native insect herbivore in western
        North America, can successfully attack and reproduce in most species of Pinus

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Linkage among genes experiencing different
        selection pressures can make natural selection less efficient. Theory predicts
        that when local adaptation is driven by complex and non-covarying stresses,
        increased linkage is favored for alleles with similar pleiotropic effects,
        with increased recombination favored among alleles with contrasting pleiotropic
        effects. Here, we introduce a framework to test these predictions with a co-association
        network analysis, which clusters loci based on differing associations. We
        use this framework to study the genetic architecture of local adaptation to
        climate in lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta, based on associations with environments.
        Results We identify many clusters of candidate genes and SNPs associated with
        distinct environments, including aspects of aridity and freezing, and discover
        low recombination rates among some candidate genes in different clusters.
        Only a few genes contain SNPs with effects on more than one distinct aspect
        of climate. There is limited correspondence between co-association networks
        and gene regulatory networks. We further show how associations with environmental
        principal components can lead to misinterpretation. Finally, simulations illustrate
        both benefits and caveats of co-association networks. Conclusions Our results
        support the prediction that different selection pressures favor the evolution
        of distinct groups of genes, each associating with a different aspect of climate.
        But our results went against the prediction that loci experiencing different
        sources of selection would have high recombination among them. These results
        give new insight into evolutionary debates about the extent of modularity,
        pleiotropy, and linkage in the evolution of genetic architectures.", "title":

        of this insect in its native habitat led to studies to evaluate its potential

        a different adelgid species, suggesting S. coniferarum feeds on multiple adelgid
        species. More S. coniferarum were found on pine than hemlock. DNA barcoding
        of S. coniferarum found two distinct clusters that differed by 6% divergence.

        pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) co-occur in the southern Rocky Mountains
        (USA), where mountain pine beetle (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae) has caused
        extensive lodgepole pine mortality since the late 1990s. Both species excel
        in post-disturbance high-light environments, but lodgepole pine has generally
        been thought to establish poorly on undisturbed seedbeds, and aspen suckering
        may be inhibited by intact aspen overstory. We ask whether lodgepole pine
        and aspen will regenerate in sufficient quantities to revegetate these forests.
        We visited a random sample of aspen and lodgepole pine stands across the affected
        landscape in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming to measure regeneration
        and overstory mortality. Lodgepole pine regeneration is occurring in 85% of
        stands, and most stands have &gt;550 stems ha&minus;1. The median aspen sucker
        density was 6175 stems ha&minus;1. Surprisingly, neither lodgepole pine nor
        aspen regeneration density was related to overstory mortality level. Animal
        damage is currently affecting aspen in these forests. Over 50% of stands had
        damage to 60% or more of their suckers, but 30% of stands had &lt;20% of their

        the results suggest that sufficient quantities of down lodgepole pine may
        protect aspen from damage and allow aspen to successfully recruit to the overstory.
        Multiple regression analysis showed that down lodgepole pine basal area, followed
        by browsing pressure, were the most important predictors of sucker height
        and the proportion of suckers browsed. Although 15% of stands had no lodgepole
        pine regeneration, aspen and lodgepole pine forests are generally regenerating
        despite animal browsing on aspen. This study is the first to present a regional

        The chloroplast genome of P. taeda encodes 120 genes, comprising 81 protein-coding

        with the same topologies, and P. taeda was closely related to P. contorta

        "Research Highlights: The biology of mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus
        ponderosae Hopkins, in Colorado&rsquo;s lodgepole pine forests exhibits similarities
        and differences to other parts of its range. Brood emergence was not influenced
        by stand density nor related to tree diameter. The probability of individual
        tree attack is influenced by stocking and tree size. Findings have implications
        for understanding MPB as a disturbance agent and for developing management
        strategies. Background and Objectives: MPB causes extensive tree mortality
        of lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon, across the western US
        and Canada and is probably the most studied bark beetle in North America.
        However, most of the current knowledge on the biology and ecology of MPB in
        lodgepole pine comes from the Intermountain Region of the US and western Canada.
        Little information is available from Colorado. This is the first study addressing
        effects of stand stocking levels on the biology of MPB and quantifying phloem
        consumption. In addition, although data are available on the conditions that
        foster stand infestation, this is the first study estimating the probability
        of individual tree attack among stands of known different stocking. Materials
        and Methods: Studies were conducted in managed lodgepole pine stands in Colorado.
        Unbaited traps were used to monitor MPB flight across stands of different
        densities. Cages were used to monitor emergence and bark samples to determine
        attack densities, and phloem consumption in trees growing under different
        stocking. Beetle collections were used to determine emergence across the growing
        season. Tree mortality data from plots of different densities were used to
        examine the probability of individual tree infestation. Results: More beetles
        were caught flying through higher density stands. More attacks were observed
        in lower stocking stands but there were no differences in the number of insects
        emerging nor phloem consumption. There was no relationship between tree size
        and beetle emergence. Peak flight occurred in early to mid-August and only
        one peak of beetle emergence occurred. The probability of tree attack was
        influenced by stand stocking and tree diameter. Conclusions: In general, aspects
        of the biology of MPB in Colorado exhibit similarities and differences with
        other regions. The data suggest the need to more closely examine how MPB functions
        in stands of different stocking and how the distribution of tree sizes influence
        the probability of infestation and extent of mortality in stands. Biological
        characteristics of MPB in Colorado need further examination, particularly
        as climate change continues to manifest. Baseline information will be critical
        to refine management approaches, and extend the understanding of how MPB contributes
        to shape forest composition and structure in Colorado.", "subject": [{"scheme":

        ecological filtering for native ranges of forest trees and are predisposing
        factors underlying forest ecosystem dynamics, the extent and severity of drought
        raises reasonable concerns for carbon storage and species diversity. Based
        on historical data from common garden experiments across the Pacific Northwest
        region, we developed non-linear niche models for height-growth trajectories
        of conifer trees at the sapling stage using annual or seasonal climatic variables.
        The correlations between virtual tree height for each locality and ecosystem
        functions were respectively assessed. Best-fitted models were composed of
        two distinct components: evapotranspiration and the degree-days disparity
        for temperature regimes between 5\u2009\u00b0C and 18\u2009\u00b0C (effective
        temperature sum and growth temperature, respectively). Tree height prediction
        for adaptive generalists (e.g., Pinus monticola, Thuja plicata) had smaller
        residuals than for specialists (e.g., Pinus contorta, Pseudotsuga menziesii),
        albeit a potential confounding factor \u2013 tree age. Discernably, there
        were linearly positive patterns between tree height growth and ecosystem functions
        (productivity, biomass and species diversity). Additionally, there was a minor
        effect of tree diversity on height growth in coniferous forests. This study
        uncovers the implication of key ecological filtering and increases our integrated

        "Increased mortality of forest trees, driven directly or indirectly by climate
        change, is occurring around the world. In western North America, whitebark
        pine, a high elevation keystone species, and lodgepole pine, a widespread
        ecologically and economically important tree, have experienced extensive mortality
        in recent climate-driven outbreaks of the mountain pine beetle. However, even
        in stands experiencing high levels of mortality, some mature trees have survived.
        We hypothesized that the outbreak acted as a natural selection event, removing
        trees most susceptible to the beetle and least adapted to warmer drier conditions.
        If this was the case, genetic change would be expected at loci underlying
        beetle resistance. Given we did not know the basis for resistance, we used
        inter-simple sequence repeats to compare the genetic profiles of two sets
        of trees, survivors (mature, living trees) and general population (trees just
        under the diameter preferred by the beetles and expected to approximate the
        genetic structure of each tree species at the site without beetle selection).
        This method detects high levels of polymorphism and has often been able to
        detect patterns associated with phenotypic traits. For both whitebark and
        lodgepole pine, survivors and general population trees mostly segregated independently
        indicating a genetic basis for survivorship. Exceptions were a few general
        population trees that segregated with survivors in proportions roughly reflecting
        the proportion of survivors versus beetle-killed trees. Our results indicate
        that during outbreaks, beetle choice may result in strong selection for trees
        with greater resistance to attack. Our findings suggest that survivorship
        is genetically based and, thus, heritable. Therefore, retaining survivors
        after outbreaks to act as primary seed sources could act to promote adaptation.
        Further research will be needed to characterize the actual mechanism(s) of
        resistance.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Plant culture", "code":

        "Insufficient chilling resulting from rising winter temperatures associated
        with climate warming has been an area of particular interest in boreal and
        temperate regions where a period of cool temperatures in fall and winter is
        required to break plant dormancy. In this study, we examined the budburst
        and growth of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), balsam poplar
        (Populus balsamifera L.), white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), black spruce
        (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss),
        jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.
        ex. Loud.) seedlings subjected to typical northern Ontario, Canada, spring
        conditions in climate chambers after different exposures to natural chilling.
        Results indicate that chilling requirements (cumulative weighted chilling
        hours) differed substantially among the seven species, ranging from 300 to
        500 h for spruce seedlings to more than 1100 h for trembling aspen and lodgepole
        pine. Only spruce seedlings had fulfilled their chilling requirements before
        December 31, whereas the other species continued chilling well into March
        and April. Species with lower chilling requirements needed more heat accumulation
        for budburst and vice versa. Insufficient chilling delayed budburst but only
        extremely restricted chilling hours (&lt;400) resulted in abnormal budburst
        and growth, including reduced needle and shoot expansion, early budburst in
        lower crowns, and erratic budburst on lower stems and roots. Effects, however,
        depended on both the species\u2019 chilling requirements and the chilling\u2013heat
        relationship. Among the seven tree species examined, trembling aspen is most
        likely to be affected by reduced chilling accumulation possible under future
        climate scenarios, followed by balsam poplar, white birch, lodgepole pine,

        on biodiversity are controversially discussed in literature. While some authors
        stress positive effects, others tend to attribute a largely negative influence
        to plantations. One important factor steering the influence on biodiversity
        are management practices. A second important factor is the environmental matrix.
        Chile offers the option to analyse both factors jointly. The coastal range
        of central Chile has experienced rapid and widespread replacement of native
        Nothofagus spp. forests in favour of Pinus radiata plantations. Here, native
        forests remain limited to small patches surrounded by an environmental matrix
        of plantations. Management is rather intensive and not designed to maintain
        biodiversity. While in the coastal range of central Chile the transformation
        from native forests to non-native tree plantations has almost come to an end,
        spatial extension of P. contorta and P. ponderosa plantations has just recently
        begun in Chilean Patagonia. While the management is similar to central Chile,
        plantations rather exist as small patches surrounded by an environmental matrix
        of native plant formations (e.g. Nothofagus spp. forests and Nothofagus spp.
        scrublands). In the framework of this work, effects of the two diametric land
        usages on biodiversity are assessed and compared. Biodiversity is assessed
        at the \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-scale. At the \u03b1-scale, biodiversity
        impacts are inferred statistically, using one-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s PostHoc
        test. Biodiversity of plants at both sites is significantly reduced in plantations
        when compared to native forests or scrublands. Plantation forestry lowers
        \u03b1-biodiversity and does not provide additional habitats for specialists.
        At the \u03b2-scale, weak edge effects due to the presence of native forests
        are observed. In total, plantation forestry tends to promote plant invasions
        and impairs the survival of endemics. At the \u03b3-scale, plant species communities
        where predominantly native and endemic in forests, predominantly introduced
        in plantations. Positive effects of the more native environmental matrix in
        Patagonia are not found to be stronger than in central Chile, therefore it
        is concluded that management imposes a much stronger influence. Results show,
        that the biodiversity impacts in Central Chile are transferable to Chilean
        Patagonia, where plantation forestry is increasingly established.", "title":

        pine (Pinus contorta and Pinus banksiana) trees in the field. Tree defense
        response was initiated by inoculation of trees with the MPB-associated fungus
        Grosmannia clavigera and measured through monoterpene emission from tree boles
        and concentration of defensive compounds in phloem, needles, and necrotic
        tissues. Lodgepole pine generally emitted higher amounts of monoterpenes than
        jack pine; particularly from fungal-inoculated trees. Compared to non-inoculated
        trees, fungal inoculation increased monoterpene emission in both species,
        whereas water treatment had no effect on monoterpene emission. The phloem
        of both pine species contains (-)-\u03b1-pinene, the precursor of the beetle\u2019s

        jack pine. The concentration of defensive compounds was 70-fold greater in
        the lesion tissue in jack pine, but only 10-fold in lodgepole pine compared
        to healthy phloem tissue in each species, respectively. Water-deficit treatment
        inhibited an increase of L-limonene as response to fungal inoculation in lodgepole
        pine phloem. The amount of myrcene in jack pine phloem was higher in water-deficit
        trees compared to ambient trees. Beetles reared in jack pine were not affected
        by either water or biological treatment, whereas beetles reared in lodgepole
        pine benefited from fungal inoculation by producing larger and heavier female
        offspring. Female beetles that emerged from jack pine bolts contained more
        fat than those that emerged from lodgepole pine, even though lodgepole pine
        phloem had a higher nitrogen content than jack pine phloem. These results

        and the availability of regeneration microsites on the establishment of the
        alien species <em>Pinus contorta</em> into a high elevation site in New Zealand.
        Spread has occurred from two stands planted at the elevation of the native
        treeline (1347\u20131388 masl) in the 1960s. Most stems established between
        1350 and 1450 masl and <em>P. contorta</em> individuals were found up to 270
        m above the original plantings. Although the population has increased by 180%
        in the last 20 years, population growth rate has been declining. Furthermore,
        comparisons with studies from other mountain ranges around the world and at
        low elevations in New Zealand suggest this is a relatively limited spread.
        Our results suggest that climate variation did not have a significant effect
        on establishment patterns, as opposed to availability of regeneration microsites.
        Soil and alpine mat microsites favoured establishment of<em> P. contorta</em>
        and, although these microsites did not appear to be saturated, microsite availability
        may be an important limiting factor for the spread of <em>P. contorta.</em>
        Thus management strategies should focus on preventing spread in addition to
        removing already established stems.", "title": "Influence of climate and regeneration

        chips left in these piles can generate leachate that contaminates streams
        when processing sites are connected to waterways. Leachate toxicity and chemistry
        were assessed for pure aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), lodgepole pine
        (Pinus contorta Dougl.), hybrid white spruce (Picea engelmannii x glauca Parry),
        and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton) as well as from two wood
        chipping sites using mixes of lodgepole pine and hybrid or black spruce. Leachate
        was generated using rainfall simulation, a static 28-day laboratory assay,
        and a field-based exposure. Leachate generated by these exposures was analyzed
        for organic matter content, phenols, ammonia, pH, and toxicity. Findings indicate
        that all wood chip types produced a toxic leachate despite differences in
        their chemistry. The consistent toxicity response highlights the need for
        runoff management that will disconnect processing sites from aquatic environments.",
