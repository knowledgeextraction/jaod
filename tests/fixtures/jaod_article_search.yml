        "Objective: This study examines the effects of hydrostatic pressure on in
        vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes derived from in vitro grown follicles.Materials
        and Methods: In this experimental study, preantral follicles were isolated
        from 12-day-old female NMRI mice. Each follicle was cultured individually
        in Alpha Minimal Essential Medium (\u03b1-MEM) under mineral oil for 12 days.
        Then, follicles were induced for IVM and divided into two groups, control
        and experiment. In the experiment group follicles were subjected to 20 mmHg
        pressure for 30 minutes and cultured for 24-48 hours. We assessed for viability
        and IVM of the oocytes. The percentage of apoptosis in cumulus cells was determined
        by the TUNEL assay. A comparison between groups was made using the student\u2019s
        t test.Results: The percentage of metaphase II oocytes (MII) increased in
        hydrostatic pressure-treated follicles compared to controls (p<0.05). Cumulus
        cell viability reduced in hydrostatic pressure-treated follicles compared
        to controls (p<0.05). Exposure of follicles to pressure increased apoptosis
        in cumulus cells compared to controls (p<0.05).Conclusion: Hydrostatic pressure,
        by inducing apoptosis in cumulus cells, participates in the cumulus oocyte
        coupled relationship with oocyte maturation.", "end_page": "293"}, "created_date":

        is generally accepted that human motor memory contains neural representations
        of the physics of the musculoskeletal system and the objects in the environment.
        These representations are called internal models. Force field studies, in
        which subjects have to adapt to dynamic perturbations induced by a robotic
        manipulandum, are an established tool to analyze the characteristics of such
        internal models. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether catch
        trials during force field learning could influence the consolidation of motor
        memory in more complex tasks. Thereby, the force field was more than double
        the force field of previous studies (35 Ns/m). Moreover, the arm of the subjects
        was not supported. A total of forty-six subjects participated in this study
        and performed center-out movements at a robotic manipulandum in two different
        force fields. Two control groups learned force field A on day 1 and were retested
        in the same force field on day 3 (AA). Two test groups additionally learned
        an interfering force field B (=-A) on day 2 (ABA). The difference between
        the two test and control groups, respectively, was the absence (0%) or presence
        (19%) of catch trials, in which the force field was turned off suddenly. The
        results showed consolidation of force field A on day 3 for both control groups.
        Test groups showed no consolidation of force field A (19% catch trials) and
        even poorer performance on day 3 (0% catch trials). In conclusion, it can
        be stated that catch trials seem to have a positive effect on the performance
        on day 3 but do not trigger a consolidation process as shown in previous studies
        that used a lower force field viscosity with supported arm. These findings
        indicate that the results of previous studies in which less complex tasks
        were analyzed, cannot be fully transferred to more complex tasks. Moreover,
        the effects of catch trials in these situations are insufficiently understood
        and further research is needed.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Psychology",

        poor households. We used questionnaire data, which gave a thorough analysis
        of the reactions, behavior, and strategies adopted by poor households as a
        result of various forms of risk. Social security has an effect on a number
        of different areas, including health, education, housing, and income. Our
        methodology explored both complete and partial risk-sharing, to investigate
        the impact of social security schemes on the strategies adopted by households
        to cope with economic shocks. The estimation results of different models showed
        that social security could help social security-covered households choose
        less costly strategies to cope with risks. However, the role of social security
        remains insufficient, given that covered households had less confidence in
        its services and they adopted strategies of self-insurance or income smoothing.
        Overall, the results showed that social security plays an important role in
        Metlaoui, but it remains insufficient, especially for households that are
        not covered by social security and are suffering from heavy health expenditures.",

        "Abstract The genetic basis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is poorly
        understood. Variation in transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) has been associated
        with enhanced neuroinflammation during aging and with TDP-43-related neurodegenerative
        disease, and rs3173615, a missense coding SNP in TMEM106B, has been implicated
        as a functional variant in these processes. Neuroinflammation and TDP-43 pathology
        are prominent features in CTE. The purpose of this study was to determine
        whether genetic variation in TMEM106B is associated with CTE risk, pathological
        features, and ante-mortem dementia. Eighty-six deceased male athletes with
        a history of participation in American football, informant-reported Caucasian,
        and a positive postmortem diagnosis of CTE without comorbid neurodegenerative
        disease were genotyped for rs3173615. The minor allele frequency (MAF\u2009=\u20090.42)
        in participants with CTE did not differ from previously reported neurologically
        normal controls (MAF\u2009=\u20090.43). However, in a case-only analysis among
        CTE cases, the minor allele was associated with reduced phosphorylated tau
        (ptau) pathology in the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) (AT8 density, odds
        ratio [OR] of increasing one quartile\u2009=\u20090.42, 95% confidence interval
        [CI] 0.22\u20130.79, p\u2009=\u20090.008), reduced neuroinflammation in the
        DLFC (CD68 density, OR of increasing one quartile\u2009=\u20090.53, 95% CI
        0.29\u20130.98, p\u2009=\u20090.043), and increased synaptic protein density
        (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.306, 95% CI 0.065\u20130.546, p\u2009=\u20090.014).
        Among CTE cases, TMEM106B minor allele was also associated with reduced ante-mortem
        dementia (OR\u2009=\u20090.40, 95% CI 0.16\u20130.99, p\u2009=\u20090.048),
        but was not associated with TDP-43 pathology. All case-only models were adjusted
        for age at death and duration of football play. Taken together, variation
        in TMEM106B may have a protective effect on CTE-related outcomes.", "title":
